# 🤖 Gesture-Controlled Mobile Robot (ROS 2)

This repository documents my work on a **gesture-controlled autonomous mobile robot** developed using **ROS 2**, bridging computer vision, human–robot interaction, and mobile robotics simulation.

Building on my foundation in URDF, Xacro, Gazebo, and RViz, this project focuses on controlling a mobile robot using **hand gestures detected via MediaPipe**, translating human motion into real-time robot navigation inside a simulated environment.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a gesture-based control system for a mobile robot by integrating:

* ROS 2 mobile robot simulation (Gazebo)
* Hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe
* Python-based gesture processing node
* Differential drive motion control
* Real-time command publishing in ROS 2

This project explores **intuitive human–robot interaction**, where the robot responds naturally to human hand movements rather than traditional input devices.

## 🚀 Milestones

* Created a mobile robot simulation in Gazebo
* Integrated MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking
* Developed a gesture control ROS 2 node
* Achieved smooth gesture-based robot motion
* Validated control logic in simulation

## 📌 Significance

This project represents a step toward **natural and intuitive robot control**.

Instead of keyboards or joysticks, the robot responds directly to human gestures — a core idea behind collaborative robots and future autonomous systems.

It also reinforced the importance of synchronizing perception, decision-making, and motion in robotic systems.

## 🔮 Next Steps

Planned improvements include:

* Gesture smoothing and filtering
* Closed-loop control using simulated encoders
* Camera-based obstacle awareness
* Integration with ROS 2 Navigation Stack
* Transition from simulation to real hardware
